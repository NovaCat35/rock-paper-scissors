# Rock-paper-scissors

This project used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make a ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR bot vs user match! It was a rough start at first, especially when things straight up won't work, but wow was the end result awesome! It was a lot of fun starting off from a simple terminal program to making a full blown UI. Don't just take my word for it, check out what I created below!
